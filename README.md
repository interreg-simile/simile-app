## Development setup

The application is written using:
- [Angular 10](https://v10.angular.io/docs)
- [Ionic 5](https://ionicframework.com/docs)
- [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)

To develop the service locally you need Node.js installed with the Ionic CLI package:
```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Once you have all the dependencies in place, you can launch:

```shell
npm i
```

This command will install the dependencies.

Now you can go in `src/environments` folder and add your environment settings.
Create a file called `environment.ts` and a file called `environment.prod.ts` with the structure shown in `environment.example.ts`.

### Develop for Android

Follow this [instructions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android).

To sign your App for production you will need to follow this
[instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) and create a `.keystore` file.
Now create a file called `build.json` with the following content
```json
{
  "android": {
    "release": {
      "keystore": "path_to_your_keystore_file",
      "storePassword": "password_to_your_keystore_file",
      "alias": "simile_app",
      "password" : "password_to_your_keystore_file",
      "keystoreType": ""
    }
  }
}
```
Once you have the dependencies in place, run
```shell
npm run sign:android
```
to sign the App.

### Develop for iOS

Follow this [instructions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios) for development and the
[instructions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/deployment/app-store) for deployment.

### Generate resources

Resources (icons and splash screens) are generated through 
[capacitor-assets](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-assets).

Sources are located in `assets` folder. To generate resources run:

```shell
npx capacitor-assets generate --ios --android
```
