The lake plankton is made up of a series of microorganisms that are transported by the currents (in Greek, plankton means 'vagabond') and is divided into the vegetable (phytoplankton), animal (zooplankton) and bacterial (bacterioplankton) components.</p><p>Phytoplanktonic algae should not be confused with aquatic plants (macrophytes)! Phytoplankton is composed of autotrophic organisms (= producers), that is, capable of building the organic substance from which they are made starting from inorganic substances and solar energy through photosynthesis.</p><p>There are several taxonomic classes of phytoplankton such as Cloroficee, Bacillarioficee, Cryptoficee and Cyanobacteria. In particular, the Cyanobacteria in lakes, in certain environmental conditions, can reach high concentrations called 'blooms'; some species can produce toxins and pose a risk to human and animal health.</p>"

Transparency can be measured with the <a class='link' href='http://www.ise.cnr.it/crypta/limnol/energia/discosec.htm'>Secchi disk</a>, a white disc, 20-30 cm in diameter, attached to the end of a metric cord: the disc is lowered into the water measuring the depth at which it becomes invisible and that the depth at which it reappears. The average between the two measures is the transparency of a lake and is expressed in meters.</p><p>The transparency of very productive lakes (eutrophic) can also be less than 1 meter while in the less productive lakes (oligotrophic) it can also be tens of meters. In our latitudes the transparency of a lake is greater in winter, when algal production is minimal, and smaller in summer and autumn. The euphotic area of ​​a lake, that is, photosynthetically active, is estimated by multiplying the transparency measured by the Secchi Disc by 2.5.</p>"

    "text": "The <a class='link' href='http://www.ise.cnr.it/crypta/limnol/energia/termica.htm'>temperature</a> is one of the main physical properties of water. The water temperature of a lake at a specific seasonal time depends on its thermal balance, that is, on the difference between the heat contributions and losses. If the temperature of a lake is measured from the surface to the bottom, very different thermal profiles are obtained during the year. In particular, there are periods in which the water column has the same temperature from the bottom to the surface and others in which there is a high thermal gradient. This is because lakes have a thermal cycle, which mainly depends on the latitude and altitude at which the lake is located and which directly affect the quantity and intensity of solar radiation, i.e. the source of thermal energy. The thermal cycle is also influenced by climatic (rainfall and wind) and morphological factors (depth and shape of the lake basin)."

    "title": "pH",
    "text": "<p>The pH is a numerical value indicating the acidity of a solution. The water contains both hydrogen H+ and OH- ions in solution; the relative concentrations of these two ions determine the pH value. Water with a pH of 7 has equal concentrations of H + and OH- ions and is considered a neutral solution. In an acid solution the concentration of H + ions is higher than that of OH- ions (the opposite in a basic solution). The pH values ​​can range from 0 (most acidic value) to 14 (most basic value).</p><p>The pH of water is a very important parameter for aquatic life. In natural environments (rivers, lakes, seas) the pH does not vary from 0 to 14 but remains within a range of a few units around the value 7. Values ​​between 6 and 9 are generally compatible with the life of aquatic organisms. Values ​​below 6 and above 9 occur only as a consequence of discharges of acid or basic pollutants and can have lethal effects on plants and animals.</p>"

In any aquatic environment, the presence of oxygen derives substantially from the slow release of this gas into the atmosphere (which is rich in it) and from the biological processes operated by aquatic organisms. The biological processes that regulate the concentration of oxygen in the water are photosynthesis and respiration.</p><p>The dissolved oxygen in the water can be expressed as concentration, i.e. mg of oxygen in 1 L of water (mg/L) or as % with respect to saturation, or the quantity of oxygen present with respect to the maximum value, taken equal to one hundred, which can be had in the same conditions of salinity, temperature and atmospheric pressure. Values ​​above 100% (supersaturation) can be measured, for example, in the surface waters of lakes in the summer. Low saturation values, on the other hand, occur in the presence of pollution which leads to the consumption of oxygen for the demolition of the organic substance. Low oxygen values ​​(hypoxia) or total absence of oxygen (anoxia) can characterize the deep waters of eutrophicated lakes, in which the organic substance produced in large quantities in the surface layers is decomposed by the aerobic organisms that take oxygen away from the water.</p>"
